# WrappedNFT

## Besides the examples listed in the code and the reading, what might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?

- Fractional ownership: By wrapping an NFT, it becomes easier to sell fractional ownership in the asset. This can make it more accessible to a wider range of investors who may not be able to afford the entire NFT.

- Gaming and Rentable NFTs: The wrapped NFT can be lent to a user for a certain duration , which can then be used to create in-game items that can be traded or used across different games or platforms.

- Liquidity provision: Wrapping an NFT can enable it to be used as collateral or traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). 

- Interoperability: By wrapping an NFT, it can be used in different blockchain ecosystems.
